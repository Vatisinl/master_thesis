Hi there!
This repo is dedicated to my master thesis project. We studied CDK8/19 protein analyzing single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data.
So we started with differential expression analysis, transcription factors searching, GRN analysis and alternative splicing analysis. Some of these steps were conducted locally or via internet tools so not all data and info  which are parts of my thesis are not here.


Here is conclusion for this work:

CDK8/19 remain poorly understood, and their precise functions and mechanisms of action have yet to be fully understood. Each study aimed at uncovering new insights into CDK8/19 activity contributes to a broader understanding of their biological significance.

The primary goals of this work were to identify specific genes responsible for transcriptional alterations upon CDK8/19 inhibition and to explore the underlying mechanisms of CDK8/19 regulation. By integrating single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data, we aimed to determine whether CDK8/19 realize their regulatory functions primarily through transcription factors modulation or via alternative splicing processes. 

This study investigated the effects of CDK8/19 inhibition on gene expression and alternative splicing in the embryonic mouse brain and mouse testis, revealing a complex landscape of regulatory changes. The results demonstrated alterations in gene expression upon treatment with Senexin B, a specific inhibitor of CDK8/19. Differential expression analysis for mouse brain samples identified over 2,000 genes with significant changes. Since CDK8/19 inhibition leads to the activation of a larger number of genes than repression (278 up-regulated and 49 down-regulated genes among those exhibiting a fold change greater than 1.5), we conclude that CDK8/19 exerts a predominantly repressive effect in embryonic brain cells. Notably, the genes whose expression was altered upon inhibition are associated with neuronal and glial function and development. Therefore, our findings support the hypothesis of CDK8/19's critical role in brain development and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, providing a rationale for further research in this area.

CDK8/19 are kinases that regulate the activity of the Mediator complex, a protein essential for transcription. It can be hypothesized that CDK8/19 functions may be mediated through various TFs, specifically by promoting their activation or repression. Through our analysis, we identified a set of potentially associated TFs. This list includes ubiquitously expressed proteins, such as CTCF, TP53, and RAD21, whose association with CDK8/19 could stem either from a biological interaction or from the widespread use of these proteins as targets in ChIP-seq experiments. Additionally, the list of potentially associated TFs includes factors like SALL4, SOX2, REST, and Smarca4 (the latter representing a mouse gene, reflecting species-specific outcomes of the analysis tools used). We propose placing greater emphasis on the ChIP-atlas results, as this approach allows for the consideration of cross-species differences without relying solely on orthologs and accounts for cell-type-specific variations, making the analysis more precise and biologically relevant.

One might hypothesize that CDK8/19 influences the splicing process; however, our analysis, conducted using multiple methods, revealed a low number of alternative splicing events. These results suggest a weak overall connection between CDK8/19 and alternative splicing mechanisms. Nevertheless, there is evidence indicating a potential link between CDK8/19 and the alternative splicing of mRNAs from genes involved in pathways associated with the Tau protein — a key player in neurodegenerative diseases. This finding warrants further experimental validation to elucidate the role of CDK8/19 in this context.

As the second part of this project, we analyzed scRNA-seq data obtained from mouse testis, where some mice were wild type, while others were treated with tamoxifen inducing Cre activity and CDK8/19 knockout. Standard preprocessing confirmed the expected distribution of cells across clusters, corresponding to distinct cell types. The pseudobulk scRNA-seq analysis revealed that CDK8/19 predominantly acts as a transcriptional activator for genes expressed in various testicular cell types. The most significant potentially controlled by CDK8/19 genes are testis-specific.

Further scRNA-seq analysis supported the hypothesis of CDK8/19's role in TF regulation. The most notable findings were the suppression of Leydig cell function, potentially mediated by changes in TFs such as Fos, Rhox13, and JunB. These findings underscore the importance of CDK8/19 in regulating key processes in reproductive cell differentiation, which might provide insights into broader cellular mechanisms regulated by CDK8/19 in various tissues. 

Our analysis, integrating results from both bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data, revealed a potential connection between CDK8/19 and the transcription factors Tcf3 and Smarca4. This suggests that the interaction may extend beyond the nervous system and testis, potentially representing a universal regulatory mechanism across multiple cell types. These findings offer new insights into transcriptional regulation across tissues and highlight the need for further experimental validation.

However, in addition to a universal mechanism of CDK8/19 action, we also observe the activation of tissue-specific molecular pathways regulated by CDK8/19 in testes and brain. This suggests that CDK8/19 may be responsible for modulating not only shared regulatory pathways but also those that are highly specific to particular tissues or cell types. The limited current understanding of these proteins -- especially in the context of the nervous system -- combined with their known associations with cancer and developmental disorders, highlights their potential importance as targets for further research.

A significant limitation of this study is the limited availability of data related to CDK8/19. This scarcity makes it challenging to perform comprehensive comparisons and validate our findings. To address this, the next phase of the project will involve analyzing data from a new Cut\&Tag experiment. This experiment will provide information on genome-wide differences in the distribution of key transcription factors and chromatin marks associated with activation and repression under CDK8/19 inhibition. These new data will help refine our understanding of CDK8/19’s regulatory mechanisms and validate the results obtained in this study.

Overall, the results of this study highlight the multifaceted role of CDK8/19 in gene expression regulation, transcription factor activity, and alternative splicing, particularly in the context of neuronal and glial cell differentiation, as well as in testicular function. Future investigations into the specific TFs and pathways identified here, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, may reveal novel therapeutic targets and enhance our understanding of CDK8/19's role in development and disease.
